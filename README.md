# WEPP_HUC12_Scripts
Repository of python scripts that setup and run the WEPP model for future climates. Fully calibrated climate input files (.cli) are created using functions in the CMIP5_to_CLI subfolder while the input files for soil (.sol), topography (.slp), and management (.man) are prepared and edited in the prep_wepp_inputs subfolder. Once the input files are prepared and any potential manual edits have been completed (i.e. cover crop inputs), the inputs are sent to the WEPP model via functions in the "RUN_WEPP_Hillslopes" script. The outputs of each run are analyzed and compared to observed data using scripts in the "WEPP_output_analysis" subfolder.

Functions within these scripts are called in the "run_all" script which runs everything from start (input prep) to finish (output analysis). Input data/files and observed datasets should be specified in this script.
